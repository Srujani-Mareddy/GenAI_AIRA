# Q&A Chatbot with OpenAI

This project implements a question-and-answer chatbot using **Langchain Core**, **Streamlit**, and **OpenAI's GPT models**. The chatbot allows users to ask questions, and the responses are generated using OpenAI's language models. You can adjust parameters such as the model, temperature, and token limit from the sidebar.
